tidydrc

## Description
Tidy modelling of dose-response relationships with the `drc` package in `R`.    
This is a wrapper for [`drc`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/drc/index.html) by Christian Ritz and Jens Strebig, which is probably the best package for modelling dose-response.  
`tidydrc` contains two functions which make it easier to generate and plot these models. Install it with:

`devtools::install_github("angelovangel/tidydrc")`
